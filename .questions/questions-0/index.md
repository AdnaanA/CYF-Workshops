Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A JavaScript REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive programming environment where you can: 1. Read: Enter JavaScript code, 2. Eval: Have it evaluated (executed), 3. Print: See the result, 4. Loop: Repeat the process.

It’s great for testing small code snippets, debugging, or learning JavaScript in real time.
